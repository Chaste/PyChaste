    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial we show how Chaste can be used to simulate a growing cell monolayer culture or multicellular tumour spheroid.\n",
    "Like the crypt simulations, tumour spheroid simulations include cell-cycle models and force laws to determine how cells divide and move.\n",
    "In tumour spheroid simulations, however, these are also coupled to a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that\n",
    "determine the concentration of specified nutrients (e.g. oxygen) throughout the cell population. Also, unlike in a crypt simulation\n",
    "(for example), the cell population may grow substantially as the simulation progresses.\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between this tutorial and the other cell-based simulation tutorials is that a PDE is defined,\n",
    "which is used in the simulation.\n",
