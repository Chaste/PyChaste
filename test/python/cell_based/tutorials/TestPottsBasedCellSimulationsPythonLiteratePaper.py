## # Introduction
## In this tutorial we show how Chaste can be used to create, run and visualize Potts-based simulations. 
## Full details of the mathematical model can be found in Graner, F. and Glazier, J. A. (1992). 
## Simulation of biological cell sorting using a two-dimensional extended Potts model. Phys. Rev. Lett., 69(13):2015â€“2016.

## ## The Test

import unittest
import chaste.core
chaste.init()
import chaste.cell_based
import chaste.mesh
import chaste.visualization

class TestRunningPottsBasedSimulationsTutorial(chaste.cell_based.AbstractCellBasedTestSuite):
    ## ## Test 1 - A basic node-based simulation
    ## In the first test, we run a simple Potts-based simulation, in which we create a monolayer of cells, using a Potts mesh. 
    ## Each cell is assigned a stochastic cell-cycle model.
    
    def test_monolayer(self):
        
        ## First, we generate a Potts mesh. To create a PottsMesh, we can use the PottsMeshGenerator. 
        ## This generates a regular square-shaped mesh, in which all elements are the same size. 
        ## Here the first three arguments specify the domain width; the number of elements across; and the width of elements. 
        ## The second set of three arguments specify the domain height; the number of elements up; and the height of individual elements. 
        ## We have chosen a 2 by 2 block of elements, each consisting of 4 by 4 ( = 16) lattice sites.
        
        generator = chaste.mesh.PottsMeshGenerator2(50, 2, 4, 50, 2, 4)
        mesh = generator.GetMesh()
          
        ## Having created a mesh, we now create a vector of CellPtrs. To do this, we the CellsGenerator helper class, 
        ## which is templated over the type of cell model required and the dimension. 
        ## We create an empty vector of cells and pass this into the method along with the mesh. 
        ## The second argument represents the size of that the vector cells should become - one cell for each element. 
        ## Third argument makes all cells proliferate.
        
        cells = chaste.cell_based.VecCellPtr()
        transit_type = chaste.cell_based.TransitCellProliferativeType()
        cell_generator = chaste.cell_based.CellsGeneratorUniformCellCycleModel_2()
        cell_generator.GenerateBasicRandom(cells, mesh.GetNumElements(), transit_type)
          
        ## Now we have a mesh and a set of cells to go with it, we can create a CellPopulation. 
        ## In general, this class associates a collection of cells with a mesh. For this test, because we have a PottsMesh, 
        ## we use a particular type of cell population called a PottsBasedCellPopulation.
        
        cell_population = chaste.cell_based.PottsBasedCellPopulation2(mesh, cells)
        
        ## We can set the "Temperature" to be used in the Potts Simulation using the optional command below. The default value is 0.1.
        
        cell_population.SetTemperature(0.1)
        
        ## By default the Potts simulation will make 1 sweep over the whole domain per timestep. 
        ## To use a different number of sweeps per timestep use the command.

        cell_population.SetNumSweepsPerTimestep(1)

        ## We then pass in the cell population into an `OffLatticeSimulation`, and set the output directory and end time

        simulator = chaste.cell_based.OnLatticeSimulation2(cell_population)
        simulator.SetOutputDirectory("Python/TestPottsBasedCellPopulation")
        simulator.SetEndTime(50.0)
        
        ## The default timestep is 0.1, but can be changed using the below command. The timestep is used in conjunction with the "Temperature" 
        ## and number of sweeps per timestep to specify the relationship between cell movement and proliferation. 
        ## We also set the simulation to only output every 10 steps i.e. once per hour.
        
        simulator.SetDt(0.1)
        simulator.SetSamplingTimestepMultiple(10)

        ## We now pass a force law to the simulation.
        
        force = chaste.cell_based.GeneralisedLinearSpringForce2_2()
        simulator.AddForce(force)

        ## To run the simulation, we call `Solve()`.
    
        simulator.Solve();
        
        ## The next two lines are for test purposes only and are not part of this tutorial. 
        ## If different simulation input parameters are being explored the lines should be removed.
        
        self.assertEqual(cell_population.GetNumRealCells(), 8)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(chaste.cell_based.SimulationTime.Instance().GetTime(), 10.0, 6)
        
        ## To visualize the results, open a new terminal, cd to the Chaste directory, then cd to anim.
        ## Then do: `java Visualize2dCentreCells /tmp/$USER/testoutput/NodeBasedMonolayer/results_from_time_0`. 
        ## We need to select the 'Cells as circles' option to be able to visualize the cells, as opposed to just the centres. 
        ## We may have to do: `javac Visualize2dCentreCells.java` beforehand to create the java executable.
        ## Alternatively to view in Paraview Load the file `/tmp/$USER/testoutput/NodeBasedMonolayer/results_from_time_0/results.pvd`,
        ## and add glyphs to represent cells. An option is to use 3D spherical glyphs and then make a planar cut.
